# DAILY LOG 


DAY 0 BASICS OF DATA SCIENCE AND DEEP LEARING , AND SELECTED THIS LEARN-FLOW FOR FUTURE :-
      1- NUMPY BASICS
      2- SCIPY BASICS 
      2- ABOUT MATPLOIT
      3- ABOUT CONVOULUTIONS
      4- KERAS FOR NEURAL NETS
      5- TENSORFLOW BASICS
      6- SCIKIT-LEARN(SKLEARN)
      7- DEEPLEARNIG.AI(COURSERA)
DAY 1 NUMPY BASICS AND DOCUMENTATION (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html)
DAY 2 MATPLOIT BASICS PLOTED GRAPHS OF BASIC FUNCTIONS, AND READ ABOUT SCIPY NDIMAGE PACKAGE, SKLEARN PIPELINE USING LASSO
DAY 3 HYPERPARAMETERS AND TUNING, DIFERENT TYPES OF PREDICTION ALGOS(https://towardsdatascience.com/predictive-modeling-picking-the-best-model-69ad407e1ee7)
DAY 4 LABEL ENCODERS AND TYPES OF ENCODING(INTEGER AND HOT )
DAY 5 TENSORFLOW ENVIROMENT GPU ENVIROMENT IN ANACONDA AND JUPYTER BASICS 
DAY 6 RANDOM FORREST, KNN LINNEAR REGRESSION, DECISON TREE , FROM SCIKIT 
DAY 7 FULLY FOR COURSERA
DAY 8 FULLY FOR COURSERA
DAY 9 FULLY FOR COURSERA
DAY 10 COMPLETED CNN ON COURSERA.
DAY 11 STARTED READING ON IMAGENET PRETRAINED MODELS FOR PROJECT(PROTESET MANAGEMENT)
DAY 12 CHOSE RESNET-50 AND LSTM STRUCTURE FOR STAGE ONE (VIOLENCE DETECION) FOUND A SIMILAR TYPE PROJECT
DAY 13 START READING ABOUT FLASK FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF MODEL IN AN APP TO SUBMIT IN HACKATHON.
DAY 14 AFTER THIS I PRACTICALLY LOST TRACK OF WHAT I DID ON WHAT DAY BUT 
WHAT I TRIED TO DO -:
       GOT INTO DATA SCIENCE 
       ENROLLED IN COURSERA PROGRAM FOR START IN DATA SCIENCE 
       STARTED WITH STATISTICS AND EDA
       AND STILL IN THE PROGRAM FOR IT
       ABOUT THE PROTEST MANAGEMENT PROJECT -:
                   IT GOT SELECTED FOR FINALS IN III GWALIOR HACKATHON
                   TRING TO GET IT FOR LIVE STREAMING 
                   INTEGRATION TO AN APP (FOR THIS STARTED READING FLASK)
                   FLASK DOCUMENTATION
                   USING OF PICKLE
